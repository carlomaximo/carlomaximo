## Hey there, I'm Carlo :)

This is my github profile **wowowow**

I plan to immortalize here stuff I built that I think other people will find helpful/interesting

I am currently studying computer programming at Sheridan College and slated to graduate this April 2025. I'm very interested in the field of geomatics, and I hope to be use it and be involved in disaster risk reduction and management in the future.

I'm currently working on a campus map web app (someone hold me accountable pls, PM "where your web app at" whenever you're free)
