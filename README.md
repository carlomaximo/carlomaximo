## Hey there, I'm Carlo :)

This is my github profile **wowowow**

I plan to immortalize here stuff I built that I think other people will find helpful/interesting

I graduated from Sheridan College with a diploma in computer programming. I'm very interested in the field of geomatics, and I hope to use it and be involved in disaster risk reduction and management in the future.
